1. Download GraphDB from https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/graphdb-free/ . Install and Run it.
2. Load the university.ttl ontology in GraphDB from the Right hand menu Import > RDF. Label the repository project (not anything else) This is the unpopulated merged ontology. Make sure select ruleset OWL-Max.
When importing the ontology, have the BASE IRI field: http://www.semanticweb.org/university
2. Import the two datasets as Tabular(Ontorefine) data. Make sure the namesspaces in the settings are as the screenshot
3. Run the query1 in the SPARQL Tab of the right hand menu. This step populates the ontology from the datasets. (Make sure the ontorefine numbers a generated from your GraphDB)
4. Run the testrequests.py code after installing the necessary python dependencies. Use the remaining SPARQL queries from the queries folder and see printed results.
